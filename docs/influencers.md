# Influencer Validation Guide: The "Sister Test"

## Overview
This document outlines how different "influencers" (interventions like food, light, or meds) are expected to affect the charts in lay terms. This is used to "dummy-check" the model: if a user turns a slider up and the chart doesn't move in the way their intuition expects, the model is failing the "Sister Test."

## 1. Alcohol & Recovery (The "Hangover" Influencer)
Target: **Performance Optimizers** and **Social Recovery** users.

*   **The Lay Expectation:**
    *   **The Buzz:** "I feel relaxed immediately (GABA), but my heart starts racing or my HRV drops (Vagal suppression) while I'm sleeping."
    *   **The Hangover:** "The next morning, I expect my 'Inflammation' and 'Acetaldehyde' signals to be high, and my 'Calm' meter to be trashed."
*   **The Validation Check:** Adding 4 units of Alcohol at 8:00 PM should cause a sustained drop in **Vagal Tone** and a peak in **Acetaldehyde** that lasts into the next morning.

## 2. Nootropics & Micronutrients (The "Stack" Influencer)
Target: **Optimizers** and **Neurodivergent** users.

*   **The Lay Expectation:**
    *   **Creatine:** "I don't expect a 'hit' like caffeine. It should be a subtle, long-term lift in my 'Energy' baseline and muscle 'mTOR' readiness."
    *   **L-Theanine:** "If I take this with coffee, the 'Norepinephrine' spike from the caffeine should feel 'smoother'—less jittery (higher GABA buffering)."
    *   **Magnesium:** "Taking this at night should lift my 'GABA' and 'BDNF', helping me recover from a high-stress day."
*   **The Validation Check:** Combining **Caffeine** + **L-Theanine** should show a higher **GABA** level than Caffeine alone, buffering the "Overwhelm" meter.

## 3. Hormonal Management (The "Stability" Influencer)
Target: **Hormonal Health** users.

*   **The Lay Expectation:**
    *   **Birth Control:** "If I'm on the pill, I expect my 'Estrogen' and 'Progesterone' charts to be a flat line across the month, rather than the big waves of a natural cycle."
    *   **Inositol:** "I'm taking this for PCOS; my insulin response to a high-carb meal should be 'calmer' (more sensitive) than without it."
    *   **Seed Cycling:** "Pumpkin seeds in the first half should subtly support my 'Estrogen' peak."
*   **The Validation Check:** Changing the profile to "Oral Contraceptive: Yes" should flatten the month-long baseline variations in **Energy** and **Ghrelin**.

## 4. Neuro-Strategies (The "Brain Hack" Influencer)
Target: **ADHD/Autism** users.

*   **The Lay Expectation:**
    *   **Body Doubling:** "Working with someone else should 'prop up' my 'Dopamine' so I don't hit that mid-afternoon slump as hard."
    *   **Sensory Overload:** "Being in a loud mall (High Sensory Load) should spike my 'Adrenaline' and 'Cortisol' even if I'm just standing still."
    *   **Guanfacine:** "This shouldn't make me 'wired' like Adderall; it should just lower my 'Norepinephrine' and 'Blood Pressure' jitters."
*   **The Validation Check:** Adding a "Body Doubling" session should show a sustained, mild lift in **Dopamine** and **Oxytocin**.

## 5. Advanced Training (The "Anabolic/Catabolic" Influencer)
Target: **Coaches** and **Athletes**.

*   **The Lay Expectation:**
    *   **HIIT vs LISS:** "HIIT should be an adrenaline bomb that triggers Growth Hormone later. LISS should just be a steady 'AMPK' (fat burning) signal and a slow glucose drain."
    *   **Protein Timing:** "Taking protein right after lifting should maximize my 'mTOR' (building) signal."
*   **The Validation Check:** **mTOR** should peak significantly higher when "Protein" (Food) is added within 60 minutes of a "Lift" intervention.

## Modeled & Validated Influencers:
- **Food:** Non-linear glucose/insulin response with fiber/fat blunting and reactive hypoglycemic crashes.
- **Caffeine:** Hill-curve based melatonin suppression and multi-hour alertness kinetics.
- **ADHD Medications:** Biphasic peak and continuous delayed pulse crash for dopamine, norepinephrine, and energy.
- **Light:** Phase-dependent melatonin suppression and cortisol stimulation using Hill-curve saturation.
- **Temperature:** Immediate adrenaline/norepinephrine surges followed by continuous vagal tone rebound.
- **Movement:** Muscular glucose disposal, acute stress response, and delayed growth hormone amplification via ghrelin coupling.
- **Hormonal Health:** Baseline shifts for energy availability and appetite (ghrelin) based on cycle day (Estrogen/Progesterone).
