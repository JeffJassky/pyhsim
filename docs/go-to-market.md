# Go-To-Market Strategy: Physim (Solo Developer Edition)

## 1. Positioning: The "Simulator" Moat

As a solo developer with no medical background, your greatest asset is that you built this for your own **AuDHD, sleep, and weight management**. You are not selling a medical device; you are selling a **"Biological Sandbox."**

- **The Pivot:** Never use the word "Diagnostic" or "Treatment." Use the words **"Simulator," "Educational Tool,"** and **"Predictive Modeling."**
- **The Value Prop:** "Stop guessing why you crashed at 3:00 PM. Simulate your day before it happens."

## 2. Phase 1: The "Community Wedge" (Low Effort / High Trust)

Since you have no following, you must "borrow" audiences from existing communities where the pain is highest.

### Strategy: The "Reddit Validation" Loop

- **Target Subreddits:** `r/ADHD`, `r/Biohacking`, `r/QuantifiedSelf`, `r/Supplements`.
- **The Tactic:** Don't post an ad. Post a **"Look what I built for myself"** story.
  - _Headline:_ "I built a simulator to predict my ADHD med crashes and it actually works."
  - _Content:_ Share a screenshot of the beautiful graph showing the Dopamine/Norepi curve. Explain how it helped you solve your 4:00 PM crash.
  - _Call to Action:_ "Looking for 50 people to try the beta for free and tell me if the models match their experience."

## 3. Phase 2: Self-Service Viral Hooks

To make sales "self-service," the app must market itself through its output.

### Feature: "Share my Scenario"

- **The Loop:** Allow users to generate a unique public URL for a "Scenario" (e.g., "My Perfect Deep Work Tuesday").
- **The Viral Effect:** When they share this link on X or Reddit, the OpenGraph image should be a beautiful, high-contrast chart of their simulated neurochemistry.
- **The Result:** People click the link to "Tweak this Scenario," which leads them directly into your app's funnel.

## 4. Phase 3: Monetization (The "No-Touch" Revenue)

Keep it simple to avoid support overhead.

- **Freemium Model:**
  - **Free:** Unlimited simulation of the "Core 5" signals (Glucose, Dopamine, Cortisol, Melatonin, Energy).
  - **Pro ($12–$15/mo):** Unlock "Advanced Signals" (mTOR, Autophagy, Neurodivergent Profiles, Cycle Syncing) and "Unlimited Scenarios."
- **Pricing Psychology:** Position the Pro tier as "Cheaper than one month of the supplements you’re currently wasting money on because you don't know if they work."

---

## 5. The "Solo Dev" Safety Net (Legal & Medical)

Since you have no medical background, you must automate your protection to avoid liability.

- **The "Iron-Clad" Disclaimer:** Every page (especially the landing page and graphs) must have a footer: _"Physim is a mathematical simulation for educational purposes only. It is not medical advice. Always consult a physician before changing your medication or supplement routine."_
- **Source Attribution:** In your "About the Models" section, list the research papers your kernels are based on. This shifts the "authority" from _you_ to the _peer-reviewed data_.

---

## 6. Execution Timeline (The "Low-Effort" Launch)

### Week 1: The "Aesthetics" Polish

- Ensure the graphs are "Instagrammable" (High contrast, dark mode, smooth curves).
- Add the "Share Scenario" link feature.

### Week 2: The "Stealth" Launch

- Post the "Look what I built" story on Reddit and X (tagging Biohacker influencers like Andrew Huberman or Peter Attia-even if they don't reply, their fans will see it).

### Week 3: Product Hunt "Burst"

- Launch on Product Hunt with a "Solo Dev Story" video. Focus on the AuDHD management aspect-it's a very supportive community for builders solving their own problems.

## 7. Summary of Self-Service Growth

1. **Build** for yourself (already done).
2. **Screenshot** the results (high visual value).
3. **Post** in "Pain-Point" communities (Reddit/X).
4. **Allow** users to share their own models (Viral growth).
5. **Charge** for the "advanced" biological deep-dives (Pro tier).
